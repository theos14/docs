## What are decline codes?

When you create a payment via Primer, the request is sent to your chosen processor based on your payment workflows.

<Info>
  [See here for how to process payments on Primer](/docs/payments/process-payments).
</Info>

If the payment is not successful, the processor will return decline fields outlining why the payment was unsuccessful.

There are different reasons for payments being declined, such as:

* Technical issues with the processor or payment method
* Processor rejects the payment (typically due to fraud prevention rules)
* Issuing bank declines the payment

Each processor has a very different way of responding and handling decline codes, which is where Primer comes in. We abstract this complexity and unify all the different decline code mappings into a single, standardized way of reasoning about declined payments.

### Why are decline codes important?

Understanding why a payment is not authorized is crucial, serving as a key communication tool between payment systems, issuers, merchants and end customers.

They offer clarity and guidance when your payments encounter issues, enabling you to devise a strategy to achieve:

* **Enhanced customer experience** \- understanding the specific reason can help cardholders take appropriate action
* **Improved fraud prevention** \- help protect cardholders from unauthorized charges and your business from chargeback fees
* **Boost payment success** \- optimize your authorization rates by analyzing decline reasons and identifying areas of improvement

### Decline codes on Primer

Below are the fields you need to consider when evaluating why a payment wasn’t successful:

| Field | Description | Payment Object fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payment Status | The status of the payment | `status`  <br/>`transactions[x].processorStatus` |
| Decision Type | The decision behind why the payment was not successful | `statusReason.type`  <br/>`transactions[x].processorStatusReason.type` |
| Decline Type | Determines if the payment had a soft or hard decline when the decision type is `ISSUER_DECLINED` | `statusReason.declineType`  <br/>`transactions[x].processorStatusReason.declineType` |
| Decline Reason | The decline reason if the decision type is `ISSUER_DECLINED` | `statusReason.code`  <br/>`transactions[x].processorStatusReason.code` |
| Error Message | The error message provided by the processor | `statusReason.message`  <br/>`transactions[x].processorStatusReason.message` |

<Info>
**What is the difference between the payment and transaction fields?**

A Primer payment can have multiple processor transactions.

* The payment fields represent the latest/final values
* The transaction fields represent the values for that specific processor transaction
</Info>

These fields are returned in the API response, as well as being included in the payment status webhook. For example:

```json JSON
{
    "id": "oWSlcuulG",
    "date": "2023-11-01T13:04:15.704780",
    "status": "DECLINED",
        ...
    "statusReason": {
        "type": "ISSUER_DECLINED",
        "declineType": "SOFT_DECLINE",
        "code": "ISSUER_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE",
        "message": "Processor Network Unavailable - Try Again"
    },
    "transactions": [
        {
            "date": "2023-10-25T12:23:20.568943",
                        ...
            "processorStatus": "DECLINED",
            "processorStatusReason": {
                "type": "ISSUER_DECLINED",
                "declineType": "SOFT_DECLINE",
                "code": "ISSUER_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE",
                "message": "Processor Network Unavailable - Try Again"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Payment Status

There are three possible payment statuses for unsuccessful payments:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `FAILED` | There is a technical problem that prevents the payment from being processed. |
| `DECLINED` | The payment was processed and declined by one of the parties in the chain, such as the processor or card issuer. |
| `CANCELLED` | The payment was canceled by the end customer. This is only used for some APMs.  <br/>  <br/>_Otherwise, CANCELLED is used when you choose to cancel an authorized payment._ |

<Info>
  [See here for a detailed breakdown of all of Primer’s payment statuses and how the state machine works](/docs/payments/primer-concepts#payment-lifecycle).
</Info>

### Decision Type

There are 3 possible decision types behind why a payment is unsuccessful:

| Decision Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLICATION_ERROR` | There is a technical problem that prevents the payment from being processed. This will only ever have `status` = `FAILED`. |
| `GATEWAY_REJECTED` | The processor has rejected the payment and has not sent it downstream to be processed. |
| `ISSUER_DECLINED` | The processor sent the payment to be processed but the card issuer has declined the payment. |

### Decline Type

There are two types of issuer declines:

| Decline Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SOFT_DECLINE` | These payments can be retried under certain conditions |
| `HARD_DECLINE` | These payments should never be retried |

<Info>
  You can face card scheme fines if you retry hard declines and over-retry soft declines, so it’s important to have a defined strategy here and ensure you aren’t breaching scheme rules.
</Info>

### Decline Reason

This should only populated when decision type is `ISSUER_DECLINED`.

Below are the decline reasons for **hard declines**:

| Decline Reason | Description | Merchant Recommended Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INVALID_CARD_NUMBER` | The issuer does not recognize the card number that it’s received. Perhaps, the account number was never issued or has been permanently blocked/closed | Evaluate for potential fraud and/or revalidate account number for accuracy |
| `EXPIRED_CARD` | The card is expired or the expiration date is invalid | Validate the expiration date prior to reattempt and monitor reattempts for potential fraud |
| `LOST_OR_STOLEN_CARD` | The cardholder has reported the card stolen or lost, and as a result, the account is either fraud-compromised or closed | Request alternate payment method from cardholder and/or advise the cardholder to contact their issuer |
| `SUSPECTED_FRAUD` | The transaction does not pass risk monitoring detection systems or controls | Advise the cardholder to contact their issuer |
| `ERROR` | Generic hard decline reason that groups a range of declines | Check the error message for more information |
| `UNKNOWN` | The fallback decline reason if the decline code is not mapped. We conduct regular audits of this bucket of payments and update our mappings accordingly | Check the error message for more information |

Below are the decline reasons for **soft declines**:

| Decline Reason | Description | Merchant Recommended Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REFER_TO_CARD_ISSUER` | The card issuer has indicated an issue with this card and requests contact from the customer | The shopper can try again after they resolved the issue with their bank/issuer |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | Transaction amount exceeds the cardholder’s available balance | May reattempt for a lesser amount or at a later date to allow the customer to fund their debit account or pay down their credit account |
| `WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | The amount and/or count activity limit for the account has been exceeded | Do not reattempt the transaction the same day to allow limits to reset |
| `ISSUER_TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE` | The issuer’s system is unable to perform the authorization due to system malfunction or critical message failure | Reattempts can occur within the same day |
| `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` | 3DS is required for this payment | Trigger 3DS flow for this payment |
| `DO_NOT_HONOR` | This is a generic refusal that card issuers provide that has several possible causes | Check the error message for more information |
| `DECLINED` | Generic soft decline reason that groups a range of declines | Check the error message for more information |

### Error Message

This is the error message provided by the processor so this does not have a predefined set of possible values. This can give extra information that’s useful when determining what’s the best action to pursue.



Decline codes can be used in different ways to drive your payments strategy:

* Create automated flows in Workflows to handle these scenarios, such as sending an automated email to the customer for every decline due to insufficient funds - [_learn more here_](/docs/automation/create-workflow)
* View aggregated data insights on all your declines in Observability to help identify broader trends and areas of improvement/focus - [_learn more here_](/docs/observability)
* Our Fallbacks feature is only triggered for certain decline scenarios - [_learn more here_](/docs/payments/fallbacks)
* Our Adaptive 3DS feature is only triggered for certain decline scenarios - [_learn more here_](/docs/payments/3ds/overview#adaptive-3ds)
* Create Monitors on Primer to track decline reasons, so you’re always alerted to changes in processor responses - [_learn more here_](/docs/observability/monitors)
