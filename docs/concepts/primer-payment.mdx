## What is a Payment?

A **Payment** is a first-class object that unifies the representation of a user payment across all your processors or payment methods.

A Primer payment is made of:

* a **payment status** that conforms to a unified payment lifecycle

* **payment method information** such as card details

* **order details** such as line items and currency

* **customer details** such as contact information, shipping, and billing address

* a **timeline** of events created throughout the lifecycle of the payment

<Info>
  You may be familiar with the **transaction** concept used by many payment processors. Because a single Primer payment can go through multiple processors via fallbacks, retries or split routing, it can contain multiple transactions, all of which are clearly displayed on the payment's Timeline.
</Info>

## Payment lifecycle

All Primer payments conform to a unified payment lifecycle, which makes them work the same way regardless of the payment services you need.

A payment always has a **payment status**. Each payment will progress through some combination of the statuses listed below on their way through your Workflow.

A newly-created payment is assigned the status PENDING.

### Enforcing the payments lifecycle

The [Payments API](https://primer.io/docs/api/api-reference/payments-api/get-payment-by-id) enforces our payments lifecycle state machine and returns a validation error if an API call is attempted where the payment status doesn't support that action.

<Info>
  The error status code returned is `400` with `errorId` = `InvalidPaymentStatus`
</Info>

See below for the breakdown of the API requests and what's supported for each payment status (table scrolls horizontally):

| API Request       | PENDING | AUTHORIZED | SETTLING | SETTLED | PARTIALLY\_SETTLED | CANCELLED | DECLINED | FAILED |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| `POST /authorize` | Allow   | Block      | Block    | Block   | Block              | Block     | Allow    | Allow  |
| `POST /cancel`    | Allow   | Allow      | Allow    | Block   | Block              | Block     | Block    | Block  |
| `POST /capture`   | Block   | Allow      | Allow    | Block   | Allow              | Block     | Block    | Block  |
| `POST /decline`   | Allow   | Block      | Block    | Block   | Block              | Block     | Block    | Block  |
| `POST /refund`    | Block   | Block      | Block    | Allow   | Allow              | Block     | Block    | Block  |

<Warning>
  Processors may not support all the actions for each payment status outlined in the above table e.g. some processors may support cancelling a `SETTLING` payment, whilst others may not.
</Warning>

## Payment creation

Payments are created automatically by Universal Checkout - our unified client-side SDK - or manually by sending a request to the Payments API.

In both cases, the following data is required to create a payment:

* An **order ID**

* An **amount** (or a list of **line items**), and a **currency code**

* A **payment method token**

### Order ID

The Order ID offers a simple way for you to tie one or multiple payments to an order in your system.

<Info>
  You can reuse the same order ID for multiple payments. This is handy to link multiple payments together.
</Info>

### Line items and currency

They describe the total amount and the currency that will be sent to the processor to authorize and capture the payment.

### Payment method token

A payment method token is a string representing sensitive payment method credentials and customer data.

Primer provides Universal Checkout, our all-in-one Checkout SDK, to securely capture payment method data while fully embedded on your site or in your app.

By communicating directly with Primer's PCI-L1 tokenization service, Universal Checkout transforms sensitive customer data into a secure uniform string called a **payment method token**.

Universal Checkout generates a payment method token regardless of the customer's chosen payment method. This enables you to reason about your checkout flow in a unified way.

<Info>
  Our agnostic tokenization service and centralized vault enable you to handle recurring payments, fallbacks, and retries across processors without compromising UX.

  No more PSP-specific tokens — now **you** own your payment data.
</Info>

## Payment timeline

Available for every payment in the Dashboard, the payment timeline is the best representation of a payment on Primer. It displays all attributes of the payment, as well as the entire series of events that have taken place throughout its lifecycle.

Navigate, search and filter your payments with an easy-to-use interface in the [Payments](https://dashboard.primer.io/payments) section of the Primer Dashboard.

**Primer is not a black box, but rather your payments infrastructure**. Select a specific event to see the requests and responses, providing full transparency into everything that’s happened to your payment throughout its journey.
