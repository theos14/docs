## Primer's Unified Mapping Standard

_Date last updated: 13th November 2023_

We unify the decline codes across all processors and payment methods we integrate with so you only have to understand them in one way.

This guide will outline how we map issuer decline reasons.

<Info>
  [See here for an overview of what decline codes are and how they're defined on Primer.](/docs/payments/decline-codes/overview)
</Info>

### How does Primer approach this?

Where possible, we map our decline reasons to the raw response codes that the issuers provide that are defined by the card networks (e.g. Visa and Mastercard).

If the raw response code isn’t returned by the processor, we use the processor response code.
